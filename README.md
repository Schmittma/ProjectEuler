# ProjectEuler
This Repository contains my solutions for the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net "Project Euler Website") challenges. They are mainly written in Java but may contain some python if i want to use very big numbers.

## Structure

The *src* folder contains a source file for every Euler challenge so they are nicely separated. It also enables the possibility of solving in multiple programming languages if i feel like it

The *res* folder contains the given challenge files as well as some other files (e.g. prime number tables)
